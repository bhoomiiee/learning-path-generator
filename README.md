# Learning Path Generator

A system that generates personalized learning roadmaps based on a user's goal,
current skill level, available study time, and dynamically reschedules tasks
when days are missed.

## Why this project?

Many learners quit because they don't know what to study next or how to
recover when they miss days. This project focuses on creating an adaptive,
backend-driven learning plan that adjusts without breaking the final goal.

## Current Status

- Frontend prototype implemented (React + Vite)
- Backend: Planned (Spring Boot)
- Database: Planned (PostgreSQL / MySQL)

## Planned Features

- Personalized weekly and daily learning plans
- Backend-driven scheduling logic
- Dynamic rescheduling of missed tasks
- REST APIs for plan generation and updates
- Clean, extensible backend architecture

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

## Roadmap

- Phase 1: Backend setup and core APIs
- Phase 2: Scheduling and rescheduling logic
- Phase 3: Frontend-backend integration
- Phase 4: Documentation and testing
